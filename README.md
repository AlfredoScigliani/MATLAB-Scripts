# MATLAB Scripts Portfolio

Welcome to my MATLAB portfolio, where I present a curated selection of scripts developed during my research in chemical engineering. This collection highlights my coding skills and my experience in using MATLAB for solving complex engineering problems.

## Overview
Each folder contains a single `.m` script accompanied by relevant input files. You can download and run these scripts locally to explore my work and replicate the analyses.

For quick reference, the `output` folder contains sample results generated by each script, showcasing the outputs and capabilities of the code.
