# 🚀 MATLAB Scripts Portfolio

Welcome to my MATLAB portfolio, where I present a curated selection of scripts developed during my research in chemical engineering. This collection highlights my coding skills and my experience in using MATLAB for solving complex engineering problems.

## 📂 Overview
Each folder contains a single `.m` script, accompanied by relevant `data` 📊 and `Input Instructions` 📑 files.

You may download and run these scripts locally to explore my work and replicate the analyses.

For quick reference, the `output` folder 📁 contains sample results generated by each script, showcasing the outputs and capabilities of the code.
