# 🚀 MATLAB Scripts Portfolio

Welcome to my MATLAB portfolio, where I present a curated selection of scripts developed during my research in chemical engineering. This collection highlights my coding skills and experience in using MATLAB to solve complex engineering problems.

## 📂 Overview
Each folder includes:
- A single `.m` script.
- Relevant `data` 📊 and `Input Instructions` 📑 files.

Feel free to download and run these scripts locally to explore my work and replicate the analyses.

The `output` folder 📁 contains sample results generated by each script, showcasing the outputs and capabilities of the code.

All `.m` files are also compiled in a single folder, `all codes`, for easy access to the entire portfolio.
