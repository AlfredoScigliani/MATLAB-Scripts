# 🚀 MATLAB Scripts Portfolio

Welcome to my MATLAB portfolio, where I present a curated selection of scripts developed during my Ph.D. research in Chemical Engineering. This collection highlights my coding skills and experience in using MATLAB to solve complex engineering problems.

## 📂 Overview  
The portfolio is organized as follows:
-  📁 `All Codes` contains all `.m` files for easy access to the entire portfolio.
- **Each code** has its own folder, which includes:
  - A single `.m` script.
  - Relevant `data` 📊 and `Input Instructions` 📑 files.
  - The `output` folder 📁 contains sample results generated by the script, showcasing the capabilities of the code.

Feel free to download and run these scripts locally to explore my work and replicate the analyses.
