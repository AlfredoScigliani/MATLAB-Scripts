# 🚀 MATLAB Scripts Portfolio  

Welcome to my MATLAB portfolio, a curated selection of scripts developed during my Ph.D. research in Chemical Engineering. This repository showcases my expertise in leveraging MATLAB to tackle complex engineering challenges.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

Start exploring my work by navigating to the **`All Codes`** folder located at the top left of this repository.  

- **`All Codes`** 📂: Contains all `.m` files for quick access to the entire portfolio.  
- **Individual Code Folders**: Each script has its own folder, which includes:  
  - A single `.m` script.  
  - Relevant `data` 📊 and `Input Instructions` 📑 files.  
  - The `output` folder 📁 with sample results generated by the script, showcasing its capabilities.  

Feel free to download and run these scripts locally to explore my work and replicate the analyses.
